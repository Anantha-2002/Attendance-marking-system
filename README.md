
The algorithm will be used for recognition of people from a database, and marking their attendance automatically. This will be made possible using realtime video capture, face detection and
face recognition ML models. The attendance will be marked in an external Google sheet. This
algorithm helps in easier and faster attendance marking. It also helps in avoiding proxy done by
some students. Also, in an exam hall only the student registered for the exam will be able to write
the exam as his attendance will be marked on the basis of the face recognition.
